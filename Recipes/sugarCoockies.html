        <p>This is the best sugar cookie recipe and the only one I use. Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe â€” you will be asked for it, I promise! Note: I make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I "paint" the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Use unsalted butter that's just soft enough to be pliable, but not warm enough to be greasy. If you press your fingertip into the butter it should leave a slight indentation, but should not be soft and mushy.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Simply spoon white granulated sugar into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat edge of a knife, spatula, or bench scraper.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Use cool or room temperature large eggs.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong>: For the best flavor, use real vanilla extract instead of imitation vanilla.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Use all-purpose flour. To measure flour, fluff it up with a spoon in the bag or container, then use the spoon to scoop it into the measuring cup and level it off. Don't pack the flour into the measuring cup or the ingredient ratio will be off and your cookies may turn out too dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder is a leavening agent and helps the cookie dough rise while baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Use regular table salt for this recipe.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar</strong>: The first thing you'll do is beat together the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (hand-held or stand mixer) until the mixture is light and fluffy. Depending on the mixer you use, this could take four to five minutes. Why do you cream butter and sugar in the first place? It's all about incorporating air into the mixture. The micro pockets of air you create by creaming cause the dough to rise as it bakes so your cookies will be light in texture instead of flat and dense. Cool (not cold) butter works best; butter that's too warm won't let you create the structure you need.</li>
            <li><strong>Add eggs and vanilla</strong>: After the butter and sugar are creamed, add the eggs and vanilla. Many home cooks like to add the eggs one at a time. You'll want the eggs and vanilla to be thoroughly mixed into the butter and sugar before adding the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Add flour, baking powder, and salt</strong>: Measure these dry ingredients into a separate bowl, whisk them together thoroughly, then turn your mixer to a lower speed and stir the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture. Be sure to scrape the sides of the mixing bowl a couple of times so there are no streaks of flour in the dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover and chill the dough</strong>: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. This firms up the butter in the dough and helps prevent the cookies from spreading as they bake.</li>
        </ol>
